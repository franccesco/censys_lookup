Censys Lookup
======================
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/franccesco/censys_lookup.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/franccesco/censys_lookup)

It's a little script to aide my assesment, I often use censys to analize IP addresses and blocks. The tool is in alpha stage, I intend this tool to output esential information about a target passively, without being spotted and output the information in CSV, JSON, a list of IP addresses founds or hostnames, maybe SHODAN and other recon tools in the future, but in the meantime just a simple Censys script.

Disclaimer: This is a newbie code :)
